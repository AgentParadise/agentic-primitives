# OpenAI Analytics Configuration (Future)
# Configuration template for when OpenAI adds hook support
#
# Status: 🚧 PLANNED - Not yet implemented
# OpenAI does not currently have a hook system like Claude Code.
# This is a template for future implementation.

# Expected OpenAI hook events (TBD - OpenAI may use different event names)
events:
  - SessionStart
  - SessionEnd
  - PromptSubmit       # May differ from Claude's "UserPromptSubmit"
  - ToolStart          # May differ from Claude's "PreToolUse"
  - ToolComplete       # May differ from Claude's "PostToolUse"
  - PermissionRequest
  - AgentStop
  - Notification

middleware:
  # Stage 1: OpenAI event normalizer
  - name: "openai-event-normalizer"

# Notes for future implementation:
#
# 1. OpenAI adapter needed:
#    - Create services/analytics/src/analytics/adapters/openai.py
#    - Map OpenAI event format to normalized schema
#    - Add OpenAI-specific field mappings
#
# 2. OpenAI may have different event schema:
#    - Different field names (camelCase vs snake_case?)
#    - Different event types
#    - Additional or missing fields
#
# 3. Analytics system is provider-agnostic:
#    - No changes needed to core Pydantic models
#    - No changes needed to publisher
#    - Only need to add OpenAI adapter
#
# 4. Testing:
#    - Create test fixtures with OpenAI event format
#    - Test adapter with real OpenAI events
#    - Verify normalized output matches schema
#
# 5. Integration path:
#    - Wait for OpenAI to add hook system
#    - Implement OpenAI adapter based on their schema
#    - Test with real OpenAI events
#    - Deploy to OpenAI-based systems
#
# This file serves as a template and documentation
# of intent to support OpenAI when hooks are available.
