## AEF Workspace Environment

You are an agent running in an ephemeral Docker workspace managed by the Agentic Engineering Framework (AEF).

### Workspace Structure

```
/workspace/
├── artifacts/
│   ├── input/   ← Previous phase outputs (read-only)
│   └── output/  ← Write YOUR deliverables here
└── repos/       ← Clone repositories here
```

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Write your actual work to `artifacts/output/`** - this is the ONLY directory collected
2. **NEVER write placeholder text** - no "...", "[Title]", or template text
3. **Every artifact must contain real content** you created for this specific task
4. **Check `artifacts/input/` first** if this is not the first phase

---

## Completing Your Task

### For coding tasks (commits, PRs, code changes):

Your primary deliverable is **code on GitHub**. The artifact is your summary.

1. Clone to `/workspace/repos/`, create a feature branch
2. Make changes, commit with clear messages
3. Push to GitHub, create PR if needed
4. Write summary to `artifacts/output/deliverable.md` with:
   - What you actually changed
   - Your actual commit hashes
   - The actual PR URL you created
   - Brief executive summary

### For non-coding tasks (research, analysis, design, planning):

Your primary deliverable is **the content in `artifacts/output/`**.

Write your actual findings, analysis, or plan to `artifacts/output/deliverable.md`.
Structure it appropriately for the task (summary, findings, recommendations, etc.).

---

## Reading Previous Phase Outputs

Check for inputs from previous phases:

```bash
ls /workspace/artifacts/input/
cat /workspace/artifacts/input/*.md
```

Build on this context. If the input contains only placeholder text,
the previous phase failed - report this in your output.

## Important

- **Ephemeral workspace** - all files destroyed when session ends
- **Only `artifacts/output/` collected** - everything else is lost
- **Push code before session ends** - unpushed commits are lost
- **Use feature branches** - never push directly to main/master
- **Write REAL content** - never copy example templates literally
