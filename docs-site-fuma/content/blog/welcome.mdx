## Hello, World! 👋

Welcome to the **agentic-p** blog! This is where we'll share updates, tutorials, and insights about managing agentic primitives for AI agents.

## What is agentic-p?

agentic-p is a CLI tool and framework for managing **agentic primitives** — the building blocks that define how AI agents behave, what they can do, and how they interact with the world.

### The Problem

AI agents are becoming more capable, but managing their configurations across different providers (Claude, OpenAI, Cursor, etc.) is fragmented. Each provider has its own format, conventions, and limitations.

### Our Solution

agentic-p provides:

- **Unified Primitives**: Define agents, commands, skills, tools, and hooks once
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Build for Claude, OpenAI, Cursor, and more
- **Version Control**: Track changes, rollback safely, verify integrity
- **Extensibility**: Hooks for security, observability, and custom logic

## What's Coming

We're actively developing:

- 🚀 More provider adapters
- 📦 A community primitive registry
- 🔒 Advanced security hooks
- 📊 Analytics and observability features

Stay tuned for more updates!
