## Overview

Agentic primitives use **immutable versioning** to ensure reproducibility and integrity.

<Callout type="info">
Every version has a BLAKE3 hash computed from its content, ensuring you always get exactly what you expect.
</Callout>

## Version States

| State | Editable | Visible | Hash |
|-------|----------|---------|------|
| `draft` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | `pending` |
| `active` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Computed |
| `deprecated` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Locked |
| `archived` | ❌ No | ❌ No | Locked |

## Creating Versions

```bash
# Create a new version
agentic-p version bump python/python-pro

# Promote draft to active
agentic-p version promote python/python-pro v2

# Deprecate old version
agentic-p version deprecate python/python-pro v1
```

## Hash Verification

```bash
# Verify integrity
agentic-p validate --check-hashes

# Show version details
agentic-p inspect python/python-pro --version 2
```
